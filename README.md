# TypoTanks
TypoTanks is a typing game in which tanks approach your fort. Each tank corresponds to a letter, which you must hit on your keyboard to destroy it. This game was made in Unity in one hour.

## Bugs

No win or lose conditions. The tanks do 'fire' on the fort, the fort however does not have health. Doing this would take about 5 extra minutes. However because there is only 1 hour available, 5 mintues is actually a lot of time.
